This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run : Yarn start from the project folder

Review the console messages carefully to understand the flow.

This is a demo to undrstand the react life cycle methods by testing and play around this app.

Each of the button click will produce the logs in the console in the order the life cycle methods are invoked.


Have fun!!
